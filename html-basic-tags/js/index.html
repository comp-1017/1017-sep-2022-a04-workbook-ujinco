        <h3>Anchor tag (a.k.a. linking to another page)</h3>
        <!-- blocked paired
            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag.

            One should not use the link tag because there is actually a <link>
            used in the <head> section. The Anchor tag can take your to 
            a different location whether it be on a different website,
            different page in the current web site, or a different location 
            on the current page. 

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location

            target:indicates the browser page display option
            default is same display page tab
            _blank will open a new browser tab (page)

        <h3>Image tag</h3>

        <!--
            an empty (void) tag (not a paired tag)
            image tag does not have a closing tag
            the image tag has no content, however, it does have parameters
            
            parameters:
            src="relative website location"
            alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
            [title="tool tip text for the image"]
           
            Absolute addressing is a complete fixed file path
                drive:/folder/..../folder/filename.ext

            relative address begins at a specific point
            for websites, it is the "top of the website"
            reference to the desired filename is done by specifying
                the appropriate path to the desired file
            NO DRIVE

            Movement with a relative address 
            - if only the filename is given, the location is within the same folder
            - movement down the file structure is by /foldername
            - movement up the file structure is by using .. for 
            each folder level to ascend

            same folder
            ="filename.ext"

            lower folder
            ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"

            from one lower folder to another lower folder on a different branch
            .. for each level that needs to be ascended
            ="../../../nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"
